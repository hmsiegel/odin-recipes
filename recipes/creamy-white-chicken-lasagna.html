    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>White Chicken Lasagna is an easy favorite meal. It’s packed with flavor and is surprisingly easy to make! This
        cheesy Caprese Chicken Lasagna is the ultimate comfort food, loaded with classic Caprese flavors like tomatoes
        and mozzarella. YUM!</p>
    <p>White Chicken Lasagna is one of my favorite versions of this Italian dish. Caprese Chicken Lasagna loaded with
        tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil!
        This creamy white lasagna is an absolute dream! Classic lasagna is delicious, but I really love this Caprese
        lasagna version with chicken and cream cheese even more.
        Substitute chicken for beef and add in plenty of mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil. Try this recipe and you might
        never go back to the classic recipe!
        It’s no secret that I have a love affair with all things cheesy. Including my husband. He’s not quite cheesy
        enough for me…but sometimes he does giggle at the stupidest commercials, over and over again, and I love that.
        But apart from him, I just love love love CHEESE. It’s not good for any type of diet, but it sure is delicious,
        and that’s enough for me! I believe most recipes should be a little cheesy, and this cheesy white chicken
        lasagna is just that!
        Make this easy recipe for an amazing weeknight dinner and you will be in love. It’s also great to save for
        leftovers, and reheating is super simple.
        This Caprese Chicken Lasagna is filled with chicken, mozzarella, tomatoes, and a creamy cream cheese mix. Yum!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Cups cooked and shredded chicken <em>(Who actually measures chicken in cups? Shouldn't this be a weight
                measurement?)</em></li>
        <li>1 14 oz can of artichoke hearts, drained and chopped</li>
        <li>8 oz shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped <em>(Again, why are we measuring dry ingredients in liquid form? Just
                get a scale and weigh it.)</em></li>
        <li>1 1/2 packages of low fat cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup half and half</li>
        <li>1 tsp minced garlic <em>(2 or 3 cloves of garlic)</em></li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste <em>(No shit. This shouldn't even need to be said)</em></li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped <em>(Or how about 2 oz?)</em></li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles, cooked</li>
        <li>12 slices whole milk mozzarella</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350F</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine chicken, artichokes, 1 cup mozzarella, grated parmesan, 1/2 the basil and tomatoes.
            Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl using an electric mixer, beat cream cheese, half and half, garlic, and salt and pepper to
            taste until well combined. Using a spoon, stir in half the basil. Set half of the cream cheese mixture aside
            and stir the remaining half in with the chicken mixture.</li>
        <li>Take half of the cream cheese mixture (half of the part without the chicken) and spread it into a 9×13 baking
        dish, covering the bottom. Lay 3 noodles on top and then top with 1/3 of the chicken mixture. Repeat the noodles
        and chicken mixture two more times, ending with a noodle layer.</li>
        <li>Top with the last half of the cream cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Place the whole milk mozzarella slices on top in rows of three, like shown.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella over everything, and then top with more basil if desired.</li>
        <li>Bake 25 min. or until heated through.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve! Enjoy!</li>
