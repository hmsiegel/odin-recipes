    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ok, folks! One of the questions I get asked most often is how to cook chicken thighs. They're so easy to make,
        and this has become one of my most popular recipes! If you're looking for other fun chicken thigh recipes, try
        these Garlic Parmesan Chicken Thighs and these Greek Chicken Thighs! We're also loving these Grilled Chicken
        Thighs during the summer months and of course Crispy Baked Chicken Wings all year long!</p>

    <p>Questions that I hear about them the most are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>How long do I cook chicken thighs in the oven and at what temperature?</li>
        <li>How do I cook chicken thighs in a pan but make sure they turn out crispy on the outside?</li>
        <li>Should I use boneless skinless chicken thighs are bone in with skin?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I think people love the thigh meat because it's super flavorful, but they just aren't as familiar with cooking
        them as they are the breast meat. Luckily, it's an incredibly easy process that takes only a few minutes of prep
        and then the thighs bake up to crispy tender perfection on a sheet pan.</p>
    <p>And, I am here to answer those questions for you today with my favorite baked chicken thigh recipe ever, plus a
        quick video that shows just how I make them!</p>
